A quick and "lean" way to swizzle methods for your Objective-C development needs.

## Adding Swizzlean to your project

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add Swizzlean to your project.

1.  Add Swizzlean to your Podfile `pod 'Swizzlean'`.
2.  Install the pod(s) by running `pod install`.
3.  Add Swizzlean to your files with `#import <Swizzlean/Swizzlean.h>`.

### Clone from Github

1.  Clone repository from github and copy files directly, or add it as a git submodule.
2.  Add Swizzlean and RuntimeUtils (.h and .m) files to your project.

## How To

* Create an instance of **swizzlean** passing in the class of the methods you want to swizzle.
* Call `swizzleInstanceMethod:withReplacementImplementation:` for an instance method passing 
  in the selector of the method to be swizzled with the replacement implementation.  When
  passing in the replacement implementation block, the first parameter is always `id _self`
  (pointer to the 'Class' being swizzled), and the followed by any other parameters for the
  method being swizzled.
* Call `swizzleClassMethod:withReplacementImplementation:` for a class method passing in
  the selector of the method to be swizzled with the replacement implementation.
* You can check the current instance/class method that is swizzled by using the 
  `currentInstanceMethodSwizzled` and `currentClassMethodSwizzled` methods.
* The status of the swizzled methods can be seen by calling `isInstanceMethodSwizzled` and
  `isClassMethodSwizzled`.
* Use reset methods to unswizzle the instance/class methods that are currently being
  swizzled.
* Methods are automatically reset when the Swizzlean object is deallocated.  If you would like to
  keep the methods swizzled after `dealloc` is called, set the property `resetWhenDeallocated = NO`.

### Example Usage

```objective-c
Swizzlean *swizzle = [[Swizzlean alloc] initWithClassToSwizzle:[NSString class]];
[swizzle swizzleInstanceMethod:@selector(intValue) withReplacementImplementation:^(id _self) {
    return 42;
}];
NSString *number7 = @"7";
NSLog(@"The int value for number7 is: %d", [number7 intValue]);
// returns - The int value for number7 is: 42
[swizzle resetSwizzledInstanceMethod];
NSLog(@"The int value for number7 is: %d", [number7 intValue]);
// returns - The int value for number7 is: 7
```

## Testing

* Prerequisites: [ruby](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), [ruby gems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download), [bundler](http://bundler.io)

To use the included Rakefile to run Cedar specs, run the setup.sh script to bundle required gems and cocoapods:

```bash
$ ./setup.sh
```

Then run rake to run cedar specs on the command line:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake
```

Additional rake tasks can be seen using rake -T:

```bash
$ rake -T
rake build_swizzlean    # Build Swizzlean
rake clean[target]      # Clean target
rake clean_all_targets  # Clean all target
rake integration_specs  # Run Integration Specs
rake run_all_specs      # Run all Specs
rake specs              # Run Specs
```
